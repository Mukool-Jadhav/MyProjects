## Image Analysis with PHI3-Vision  Large Language Models

This repository provides a Python script (`get_image_analysis.py`) that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to analyze an image and generate a response based on a user prompt.

Functionality:

* Analyzes a local image file. (Remote URL support is currently not implemented)
* Generates text based on the user prompt and the image content using a specified LLM model.

Requirements:

* Python 3.x
* Libraries:
    * Transformers
    * Pillow (PIL Fork)
    * (Optional) Requests (for potential future remote image support)

nstallation:


pip install transformers pillow requests  # Replace 'requests' with an empty space if not needed


Usage:

1. Save the script (`get_image_analysis.py`) in your desired location.
2. Place the image you want to analyze in the same directory or a subdirectory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and image.
4. Run the following command, replacing `your_prompt` with your desired text prompt and `image.jpg` with the actual filename of your image:


python get_image_analysis.py "Write a description of this image" image.jpg

This will generate a text response based on the LLM's analysis of the image and the provided prompt.

Default Model:

The script uses the `microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct` model by default. You can change this by specifying a different model identifier as the third argument:


python get_image_analysis.py "Write a description of this image" image.jpg "alternative_model_id"


Further Considerations:

* The script currently does not handle remote URLs for images. You'll need to download the image locally before analysis.
* The provided prompt can be customized to guide the LLM's analysis towards specific aspects of the image.
* Experiment with different LLM models (refer to the Hugging Face model hub for options) to explore variations in the generated responses.

Disclaimer:

This script is provided as a starting point for exploration. The accuracy and quality of the generated responses depend on the chosen LLM model, the complexity of the image, and the effectiveness of the prompt.
